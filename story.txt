There is a prince who turned into a frog on a rainy day.

The prince did not like being a frog, he was used to his expensive way of being.He then went on a quest to find a princess who could reverse this curse. However when he tricked a woman to kiss him, it turned out that she was no princess, and she also turned into a frog.

One day, a group of travelers stumbled upon the prince, and they tried to lift the curse off of the prince. However, the travelers were inexperienced with magic, and they recited a spell that caused rain to pour from the sky. Not too long after, they too fell victims to the frog curse.

In this way, there is a group of frogs. They have no way to change back to humans and have to learn to live as a frog. From then on, whenever it rains, there will be frogs screaming, pedestrians donâ€™t know the reason, they will only follow them.
